            <p class="p1cc">
              As an ambitious and motivated undergraduate pursuing a degree in
              Information System Management, I have developed core competencies
              in system administration and IT project management. These
              foundational skills have laid the groundwork for my future career
              in the technology industry, allowing me to excel in managing
              computer systems and leading projects effectively.
            </p>

            <p class="p2cc">
              During my academic journey, I have acquired a solid understanding
              of system administration principles and practices. I have gained
              proficiency in installation, configuration, and troubleshooting
              tasks across various operating systems, including Windows, Linux,
              and macOS. Through coursework and hands-on projects, I have also
              become adept at user management, system monitoring, and
              implementing security protocols to ensure the integrity and
              confidentiality of data.
            </p>

            <p class="p3cc">
              I have actively looked for ways to improve my IT project
              management skills while in university. I've learned how to start,
              plan, and finish a project through group projects and activities
              outside of university. I've learned how to define the scope of a
              project, set clear goals, and make detailed plans. I have also
              gotten better at allocating resources, managing timelines,
              reducing risks, and ensuring that projects meet stakeholders'
              needs.
            </p>

            <p class="p4cc">
              I'm also very interested in the latest technology trends outside
              of the university. As a tech enthusiast, I always seek ways to
              learn more and improve my skills. I research new technologies,
              attend webinars and industry events, and join online communities.
              Because I am so interested in technology, I can adapt to the
              changing nature of the industry and welcome new developments.
