            <h3 class="h3expi">CODING EXPERIENCE</h3>
            <p class="p1expi">
              I have gained proficiency in HTML and CSS, which I have utilized
              to create visually appealing and responsive web pages. Through my
              coursework and personal projects, I have developed a solid
              foundation in coding principles and best practices. One notable
              project I collaborated on with a group involved designing and
              developing a website for a local business. I took the lead in
              designing the user interface, creating a clean and intuitive
              layout using HTML and CSS. I ensured that the website was
              mobile-friendly and optimized for a seamless user experience.
              Additionally, I contributed to the integration of interactive
              elements and animations using JavaScript, enhancing the overall
              functionality and interactivity of the website.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3expip2">HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE KNOWLEDGE</h3>
            <p class="p2expi">
              I possess a strong understanding of hardware components and
              software systems. I have gained practical experience through
              hands-on projects, such as disassembling and reassembling desktop
              computers, installing operating systems, and troubleshooting
              hardware issues. For instance, in a group project focused on
              computer hardware, I successfully dismantled multiple desktop PCs,
              diagnosed and resolved hardware conflicts, and reassembled them,
              resulting in fully functioning systems.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3expip3">MULTIMEDIA EXPERTISE</h3>
            <p class="p3expi">
              I have honed my skills in multimedia production, particularly in
              graphic design and video editing. I am proficient in using tools
              like CapCut for video editing and have created engaging video
              content for social media platforms. I collaborated with a team on
              a university project to produce a promotional video for a local
              non-profit organization. I contributed by designing visual
              elements, editing footage, and adding motion graphics to create an
              impactful video that effectively conveyed the organization's
              message.
