              I am a well-rounded person with many different interests that have
              helped me grow personally and professionally. These things make me
              happy and teach me useful skills and traits that improve my
              performance.
            </p>
            <p class="p2pi">
              First and foremost, I'm very interested in coding. I have a strong
              foundation in programming languages like Python and Java because I
              taught myself and worked on projects. Coding has helped me improve
              my logical thinking, attention to detail and finding new ways to
              solve problems. I keep up with the latest technology trends and
              keep learning new things to adapt to the ever-changing world of
              technology.
            </p>
            <p class="p3pi">
              Sports, especially badminton, have helped me become who I am
              today. Competing in sports has taught me to be disciplined, keep
              going, and work well with others. Playing in badminton tournaments
              improved my speed, coordination, and ability to think
              strategically. These skills have helped me a lot on the court and
              in my job, where I take on challenges with a determined attitude
              and do well in environments where people work together.
            </p>
            <p class="p4pi">
              Service to the community and volunteer work is very important to
              me. It's important to give back to society and make a difference
              in the lives of others. Participating in community service
              projects has allowed me to work with many different kinds of
              people and improve my communication and leadership skills. My
              dedication to community service shows that I want to help others
              and make lasting changes.
            </p>
            <p class="p5pi">
              In short, my interests include coding, which has helped me improve
              at logical thinking and solving problems, and sports like
              badminton, which have taught me how to be disciplined and work
              well with others. And community service has helped me get better
              at working with people and being a leader. These different hobbies
              have helped me grow as a person and in my career, making me a
              well-rounded person who is ready to take on new challenges.
